#Goal of the App:

This app strips the MP3 audio off any youtube video selected through an android app. TYhe YouTube videos are displayed in a visual list with image + title, and can be played from within the app. Once the request for mp3 extraction is submitted, the app will also download the resulting mp3 file as well.



#Description:

It requires a server running at the backend that does the extraction and places the mp3 into a Parse table that can is downloaded from the app. The design of this entire application can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzkvMWM-w80JWXpCRkoybmpZcnc/view?usp=sharing)

The Parse data tables that store the mp3 extraction request can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzkvMWM-w80JdWVQMTVQZFdXTXM)
